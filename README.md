# Font Changer

This is a project that allows you to change the font of text elements on a webpage. You can use it to experiment with different fonts and see how they look on your website.

## Q&A

<details><summary>Do you need to install modules, not only for the Python script, but for every script?</summary> 
  No, the scripts provided don't need extra modules. But they do use specific commands and tools that might not be installed by default on your computer.

For instance:

Shell (Bash), Ruby, Java, C# and C++ all need `wmctrl`  and `xdotool`.
These commands are usually available on Linux systems, but you might need to install them separately on Windows or other platforms. Make sure to have these tools installed and accessible on your system for the scripts to work properly.</details>

<details><summary>Is it against the TOS of sites/apps?</summary>
  No, it's not illegal or against the TOS of sites/apps normally, except if you have sites like Discord, they do not like modification in their system, so probaly (I'm not sure) then it is against the TOS of Discord, but for other sites, make sure to check their TOS. </details>
